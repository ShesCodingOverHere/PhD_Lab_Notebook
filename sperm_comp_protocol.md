# **Sperm Competition Assay in Drosophila affinis**  

**Objective:**  
To determine sperm competition outcomes between XO (dark-eyed) and XY (red-eyed) males in *Drosophila affinis* by assessing offspring eye color.

---

### **Materials**  
- *Drosophila affinis* stocks:  
  - **XO males** (dark eyes)  
  - **XY males** (red eyes)  
  - **Virgin dark-line females** (dark eyes)  
- Standard food vials
- Stereomicroscope for scoring offspring eye color  

---

### **Experimental Design**  
Each experimental vial will contain:  
- **10 XO males (dark-eyed)**  
- **10 XY males (red-eyed)**  
- **10 virgin dark-eyed females**  
- Multiple replicates (at least 10-20)  

Progeny eye color will indicate paternity:  
- **Red-eyed offspring** → XY sperm success  
- **Dark-eyed offspring** → XO sperm success  

---

## **Protocol**  

### **1. Preparation**  
1. **Virgin Female Collection**  
   - Collect virgin **dark-eyed females** within 6 hours of eclosion to prevent prior mating.  
   - House in separate vials until the experiment begins.  
   
2. **Male Preparation**  
   - Use **XO (dark-eyed) and XY (red-eyed) males** at **3-5 days old** to ensure sexual maturity.  
   - House in separate vials before the experiment.  
   
---

### **2. Group Mating Setup**  
1. In each **food vial**, place:  
   - **10 XO males**  
   - **10 XY males**  
   - **10 virgin dark-eyed females**  
2. Allow mating to occur **freely for 48 hours** in a **controlled environment (25°C, 12:12 light cycle)**.  
3. After **48 hours**, remove all adult flies to ensure offspring are only from sperm stored during this period.  

---

### **3. Offspring Collection**  
1. Keep vials at **25°C** and allow females to lay eggs for **3-7 days**.  
2. Collect all **adult offspring** after eclosion (~12-14 days post-oviposition).  
3. **Score each offspring** under a **stereomicroscope**, recording:  
   - **Red-eyed progeny** (sired by XY males)  
   - **Dark-eyed progeny** (sired by XO males)  

---

### **4. Data Analysis & Interpretation**  
1. **Calculate relative sperm competition success (P2’ index)** for each vial:  
   \[ P2' = \frac{\text{Number of red-eyed offspring}}{\text{Total offspring}} \]  
2. Interpretation of results:  
   - **P2’ > 0.5** → XY males outcompete XO sperm in sperm displacement.  
   - **P2’ < 0.5** → XO sperm retains higher fertilization success.  
   - **P2’ ~ 0.5** → Equal sperm competitiveness between XO and XY males.  

---

### **5. Additional Considerations**  
- **Replication:** Conduct **at least 10-20 replicates** for statistical significance.  
- **Male Courtship & Mating Behavior:** Record observations on mating initiation and duration.  
- **Sperm Storage Analysis:** If feasible, dissect female reproductive tracts post-mating to examine sperm storage sites.  
- **Control Vials:** Single-male mating trials can confirm fertility rates for each male type.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This sperm competition assay will quantify reproductive success differences between XO and XY males in *Drosophila affinis*. By analyzing eye color as a direct paternity marker, this study will provide insight into how Y chromosome loss affects sperm competition dynamics.

# **P1-P2 Sperm Competition Assay in Drosophila affinis**

**Objective:**  
To assess sperm competition dynamics by sequentially mating *Drosophila affinis* females with XY (red-eyed) and XO (dark-eyed) males in a controlled order (XY first, then XO; and XO first, then XY). Offspring eye color will determine paternity.

---

### **Materials**  
- *Drosophila affinis* stocks:  
  - **XO males** (dark eyes)  
  - **XY males** (red eyes)  
  - **Virgin dark-line females** (dark eyes)  
- Standard food vials 

---

### **Experimental Design**  
Each female will mate sequentially with two males in different treatment groups:

1. **Treatment 1 (XY first, then XO)**  
   - **P1:** Virgin female mates with an **XY male (red eyes)**  
   - **Holding period:** Female is isolated for **24 hours**  
   - **P2:** Same female then mates with an **XO male (dark eyes)**  
   - **Egg laying & offspring collection**  
   
2. **Treatment 2 (XO first, then XY)**  
   - **P1:** Virgin female mates with an **XO male (dark eyes)**  
   - **Holding period:** Female is isolated for **24 hours**  
   - **P2:** Same female then mates with an **XY male (red eyes)**  
   - **Egg laying & offspring collection**  

Progeny eye color will indicate paternity:  
- **Red-eyed offspring** → Sired by XY sperm  
- **Dark-eyed offspring** → Sired by XO sperm  

---

## **Protocol**  

### **1. Virgin Female Collection**  
- Collect virgin **dark-eyed females** within 6 hours of eclosion to ensure no prior mating.  
- House in separate vials until the experiment begins.  

### **2. First Mating (P1 Male)**  
1. Pair **one virgin female** with **one male (either XO or XY, depending on treatment group)** in a mating vial.  
2. Observe **copulation success and duration** (~10-30 min typical for *Drosophila*).  
3. After mating, **remove the male** and **isolate the female** in a new vial for **24 hours** to allow sperm storage.  

### **3. Second Mating (P2 Male)**  
1. Introduce the **second male (opposite type of P1)** into the vial with the same female.  
2. Observe **copulation success and duration**.  
3. After mating, remove the male and **transfer the female to an egg-laying vial**.  

### **4. Egg Laying & Offspring Collection**  
1. Allow the female to lay eggs for **3-7 days** in the vial.  
2. Remove the female after the egg-laying period.  
3. Incubate vials at **25°C** until adult offspring eclose (~12-14 days).  

### **5. Offspring Scoring & Paternity Analysis**  
- **Score all offspring** for eye color under a stereomicroscope:
  - **Red-eyed progeny** → Sired by **XY male**
  - **Dark-eyed progeny** → Sired by **XO male**  
- Calculate **P2’ (second male paternity success index)**:  
$$
P'_2 = \frac{N_{P2}}{N_{\text{total}}}
$$


---

### **Data Analysis & Interpretation**  
- **P2’ > 0.5** → Second male outcompetes first male’s sperm (higher sperm displacement).
- **P2’ < 0.5** → First male’s sperm remains competitive and retains fertilization success.  
- **P2’ ~ 0.5** → Equal sperm competitiveness between XO and XY males.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This sequential mating assay will provide insights into the **relative sperm competitiveness of XO vs. XY males** in *Drosophila affinis*. By analyzing paternity outcomes through eye color markers, this experiment will help determine how the loss of the Y chromosome influences sperm precedence and displacement mechanisms.
