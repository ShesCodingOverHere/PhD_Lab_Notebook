### **Experimental Design for Assessing Fertility Rescue in Evolved XO Males**  

To determine whether **experimental evolution has restored fertility** in XO males, you should use a combination of **egg-to-adult viability**, **sperm count & motility**, and **sperm competition success** assays. Below is a structured plan for each.

---

## **1. Egg-to-Adult Viability Assay (Functional Fertility Test)**
**Goal:** Assess whether evolved XO males can successfully produce viable offspring at the same rate as XY males.

### **Setup:**
- **Mating Pairs:**  
  - 20 **Evolved XO** males × 20 **virgin dark-eyed females**  
  - 20 **Control XY** males × 20 **virgin dark-eyed females**  
  - (Optional: Include 20 **Ancestral XO** males × 20 virgin females to compare with evolved XO)  

- **Replicates:** At least **10 vials per male type** (for statistical power).  

- **Protocol:**  
  1. Place one male and one virgin female in a vial with **standard food**.  
  2. Allow mating for **24 hours**, then remove the male.  
  3. Count the **total number of eggs laid** over the next **48 hours**.  
  4. Let the eggs develop to adulthood (~12-14 days).  
  5. Count the **number of adult offspring that eclose**.  

### **Measurements:**  
- **Egg-to-adult viability** = (Number of adults / Number of eggs) × 100  
- Compare **XO vs. XY** offspring production using **t-tests or ANOVA**.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- If evolved XO males produce **similar numbers of offspring as XY**, fertility has been restored.  
- If XO males still show **low offspring numbers**, sperm function or viability is still impaired.  

---

## **2. Sperm Count & Motility Assay**  
**Goal:** Determine if evolved XO males have improved sperm production and motility.  

### **Setup:**
- **Sample Size:** 10 **evolved XO**, 10 **XY**, and (optional) 10 **ancestral XO** males.  
- **Age:** Use **3-5-day-old** males (sexually mature).  

### **Protocol:**  
1. **Sperm Extraction:**  
   - Anesthetize males and dissect **testes and seminal vesicles** in **PBS** or **sperm buffer**.  
   - Gently tease apart tissue to release sperm into solution.  

2. **Sperm Count:**  
   - Use a hemocytometer (or imaging software) to count sperm per **µL of sample**.  
   - Average across replicates.  

3. **Sperm Motility:**  
   - Place a drop of sperm suspension on a slide with a coverslip.  
   - Record **videos under phase-contrast microscopy**.  
   - Count **motile vs. immotile sperm** in multiple fields of view.  

### **Measurements:**  
- **Total sperm count per male.**  
- **Percentage of motile sperm** (motile sperm / total sperm × 100).  
- Statistical comparison using **t-tests or ANOVA**.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- If evolved XO males have **higher sperm counts & motility** than ancestral XO, fertility may be recovering.  
- If sperm motility remains low, fertility issues may persist despite selection.

## **3. Sperm Competition Assay (Paternity Success Test)**  
**Goal:** Assess whether evolved XO males can **compete against XY males** for fertilizations.  

### **Setup:**  
- **Virgin females** from a dark-eyed strain.  
- **Males:**  
  - 10 **Evolved XO** males (dark-eyed)  
  - 10 **Control XY** males (red-eyed)  
- **Competition vials:**  
  - Place **1 evolved XO + 1 XY male + 1 virgin female** in a vial.  
  - **Replicate 10-15 times** per group.  

### **Protocol:**  
1. Allow the males and female to interact for **48 hours** (giving multiple mating opportunities).  
2. Transfer the female to a new vial without males and allow her to lay eggs for **48 hours**.  
3. Let offspring develop to adulthood.  
4. **Score offspring eye color**:  
   - **Red-eyed = XY father**  
   - **Dark-eyed = XO father**  

### **Measurements:**  
- **XO male paternity success** = (Number of dark-eyed offspring / Total offspring) × 100  
- Compare **evolved XO vs. ancestral XO** using **t-tests or logistic regression**.  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- If evolved XO males sire **more offspring** than ancestral XO, fertility has been restored.  
- If XO males are still outcompeted by XY males, sperm competition ability remains impaired.

## **Summary of Expected Findings**  

| Assay | Expected Outcome if XO Fertility is Rescued |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Egg-to-Adult Viability** | XO males produce as many offspring as XY males. |
| **Sperm Count & Motility** | XO males have sperm counts & motility similar to XY. |
| **Sperm Competition** | XO males fertilize a higher % of eggs vs. ancestral XO. |

### **Experimental Design for Assessing Fertility Rescue in Evolved XO Males Using ddPCR for Paternity Testing**  

Since you're shifting from **eye color markers** to **droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect the presence of the Y chromosome**, the experimental design needs to incorporate **DNA extraction and ddPCR-based genotyping**. Here’s how to adjust each assay:

---

## **1. Egg-to-Adult Viability Assay (Functional Fertility Test)**
This assay remains unchanged from before since the focus is on **whether evolved XO males can produce viable offspring**.

### **Setup & Protocol (Same as Before)**
1. **Crosses:**
   - 20 **Evolved XO males** × 20 **Virgin females**  
   - 20 **Control XY males** × 20 **Virgin females**  
   - (Optional) 20 **Ancestral XO males** × 20 **Virgin females**  

2. **Measure:**
   - Number of **eggs laid**.
   - Number of **adults that eclose** (egg-to-adult viability).
   - Statistical comparison: **ANOVA or t-tests**.

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- If evolved XO males produce similar numbers of offspring to XY males, it suggests **fertility recovery**.

---

## **2. Sperm Count & Motility Assay (Same as Before)**  
This remains unchanged because ddPCR is not needed for sperm measurement.  
- **Measure:**  
  - **Total sperm count per male** (hemocytometer).  
  - **Motility assessment** (microscopy).  

### **Expected Outcome:**  
- Increased sperm count and motility in **evolved XO** suggests fertility recovery.

---

## **3. Sperm Competition Assay (Using ddPCR for Paternity Analysis)**  
**Goal:** Determine whether evolved XO males can **compete against XY males** for fertilization, using **ddPCR to genotype offspring** for Y chromosome presence.

### **Setup**  
- **Mating Groups:**  
  - 10 **Evolved XO males** + 10 **XY males** + 10 **Virgin females**  
  - (Optional) 10 **Ancestral XO males** + 10 **XY males** + 10 **Virgin females**  
- **Replicates:** At least **10-15 competition vials per group**.  

### **Protocol:**  
1. **Competition Mating:**  
   - Place **1 evolved XO male + 1 XY male + 1 virgin female** in a vial.  
   - Allow interactions for **48 hours** (ensuring multiple mating opportunities).  

2. **Offspring Collection & DNA Extraction:**  
   - After eclosion, collect **20 offspring per vial**.  
   - Extract **genomic DNA** using a standard **Drosophila DNA extraction protocol** (e.g., Chelex or Qiagen DNeasy).  

3. **ddPCR Genotyping for Y Chromosome:**  
   - Design ddPCR primers/probes for **Y-linked sequences** (e.g., kl-2, kl-3, kl-5, or Ppr-Y).  
   - Run ddPCR with control **XY and XO DNA samples** to validate specificity.  
   - Count offspring as **Y-positive (XY father) or Y-negative (XO father)**.  

4. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Calculate **proportion of offspring sired by XO vs. XY males** in each competition vial.  
   - Compare **evolved XO vs. ancestral XO using logistic regression or χ² tests**.

### **Expected Outcome & Interpretation**  

| Assay | Expected Outcome if XO Fertility is Rescued |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Egg-to-Adult Viability** | XO males produce similar offspring numbers to XY males. |
| **Sperm Count & Motility** | XO males have sperm counts & motility similar to XY. |
| **Sperm Competition (ddPCR)** | XO males sire a higher % of offspring than ancestral XO. |
